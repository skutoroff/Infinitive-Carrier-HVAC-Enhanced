## **DISCLAIMER**
**The software and hardware described here interacts with a proprietary system using information gleaned by reverse engineering.  Although it works fine for me, no guarantee or warranty is provided.  Use at your own risk to your HVAC system and yourself.**

## My Infinitive Goals
1. Learn Go.
2. Collect HVAC temperature and fan data for charting to understand HVAC cycle times for no reason other than something to do.
3. Have some geeky fun.

## Getting started

#### Hardware setup
As with the project source developer, all my development is on with Raspberry Pi with Infinitive running on a Pi 4 and my development on a Pi 400. The Pi 4 also runs PiHole and HomeBridge with CPU loads of just a few percent. A Pi Zero would probably do fine.

Wiring to the HVAC uses solid core multi-conductor wire as intended for the purpose. Read the referenced GitHub project. The wire is run adjacent to network and alarm system wires in the basement for a distance of perhaps 20-25 feet up to the ceiling and down to my network equipment.

Found two alternatives while shopping for the RS-485 interface, TTL and USB. The original Infinitive developer used USB and reported on a driver lockup issue and suggested using USB 1 mode. The HASS version author provided instructions for running Infinitive under systemd. systemd is highly recommended, it solves any restart issue with the app or the driver and cleanly manages startup under any condition.
TTL RS-485 interface is:	dlymore TTL Serial Port to RS485 Converter Module, was less than $7.45 with shipping from eBay.
USB interface is:	U-485 USB RS485 Serial Port Converter was $8.91 with shipping, also found on eBay.

Initially used the RS-485 to TTL adapter wired directly to the serial pins on the GPIO bus which worked as soon as the wires to the HVAC were connected in January 2023. Immediately found a restart issue in the serial driver, which are frequent and found to occur between minutes and after many hours of operation. The code was adapted to these frequent restarts. Much later switched to the USB interface and found it to be stable while it would have permitted a simpler code design, the path taken was educational.

Summary, even if you enjoy wiring stuff up and want to use the GPIO pins, don't bother with the TTL option.

#### Software
Using go version 1.20.2 linux/arm. Had to fix some import statements in the source code and learn how to setup a Go environment (never saw or used Go before). The enhancements required periodic time based execution. Found [cron v3](https://github.com/robfig/cron) which provides a cron-like time specification. It is used to collect temperature and fan readings at 4 minute intervals. Another cron timer saves daily data to files and then prepares a basic daily chart using [Go E-charts](https://github.com/go-echarts/go-echarts). First pass at charting is pretty simple. Lots is left to learn about the e-chart project. The timer to purge daily data and chart files older files than 21 days seems to be working fine. Another to clear the log files 3x per month just needs another test cycle.

As for the time axis in the charts, have not yet figured out how to set up text format time in the scale. So, the daily data include a date.dayFraction representation of time for the time scale. I wanted to see a chart more than I wanted to learn e-charts at the time.

Having read through the original GitHub project information and some information from web searches, I put Infinitive under Systemd and added redirection of output and error files to /var/log/infinitive/. Infinitive is run from /var/lib/infinitive/ with data and chart files also saved there. Data files are in CSV form allowing import into Excel.
The blower RPM scale is the reported fan speed converted to off-low-med-high scale as 0, 34, 66, 100 to use the same y scale as temperarure. Temperature readings and blower RPM readings are sometimes corrupted in transmission, the code cleans up the obvious exteme errors. I'll add blower RPM as a right side scale as I get into E-charts. Changing the time scale to be text date/time is also intended. Axis labels are needed as well. So it goes.
The big problems now is understanding how to build the web user interface assets and make UI changes. Not much progress there. Working out bindata and bindata_assetfs differences and how to build the changes and not break everything.

To use the executable Pi file, install it in /var/lib/infinitive/ and set it up in systemd so the crash restarts don't get irritating. The second link at top has detailed instructions. If you configure systemd to save output and error log files as I did, save them in /var/log/infinitive/ as in my sample infinitive.service file and they will be deleted 3x per month to manage their size.

#### Problems Encountered.
As noted above, the TTL interface is far less stable than the USB interface. most early development problems would have been avoided had I never tried the TTL interface. I also would have learned less Go.

#### Plans
Besides improving the charts appearance and adding more time line options, plan to modify the web server to display uptime for my own curiosity and add a table of links to the prepared charts. Currently looking to the web server side of the original source code now that the collection is stable. Working on editing and building the assets side. Code uses bindata_assetsfx, can't build working UI changes, yet.

#### Other Nonsense
With no formal Go experience, I like Go better than many other programming languages Iâ€™ve used. I like that Go programs are a single complete executable with no additional support files. I like the sort of C like resemblance and the way objects are referenced. The object-method chaining is kind of neat, but hindered readability at first. Wonder about using the USB RS-485 interface on a Mac and building for macos. Just a thought.
